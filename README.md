# Automated-Financial-Pipeline-Report
This repository contains a fully automated portfolio analytics pipeline built in Python. It fetches historical price data, computes portfolio- and asset-level metrics, generates visualizations, and packages everything into a professional PDF report. The report can then be emailed automatically using SMTP or run on a schedule via GitHub Actions.
